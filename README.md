# Alarm-Clock-Puzzle

This code was written for IEEE @ UCSD's Fall 2022 Quarterly Projects competition.

Have you ever found yourself subconsciously pressing the snooze button for your alarm after it goes off over and over again, effectively defeating the purpose of the alarm?

This project aims to fix that by removing the snooze button entirely!

Here's the idea: 
The clock will function like a typical alarm clock, except when the alarm goes off there is no snooze button. Instead, the user must solve a puzzle by pressing the displayed buttons in the correct order - all while the alarm is going off! This way, you will never have to worry about waking up late again!

You're welcome!
